Recently I managed to attended my first Sydney IGDA meetup<p/>

wanted to attend for a while, when I first founnd out about IGDA a meetup happend the day before, then I was unable to attend because I had a uni exam the next day. Managed to convince my friend the day before to drive to sydney with me from newcastle. 

Decided the night before > so had to quickly got a build together the night before.

Had kind of given up on the game as scope might be too big

Want to submit something in the student igf

Everyone was super friendly and willing to take the time to give me adivce and feed back

learnt lots of things
most are pretty obvious but didnt really think about as only decided to go the day before, plus I didnt really expect anyone to play my game
	- Need an easy reset button so easy to setup the game for the next player
	- Need to show/explain what the controls are
	- Need basic business cards with contact details
	- Notepad to write down observations,ideas,feedback and other peoples contact details
	- hadnt spent anytime on placeholder are but other people commented that they liked the simple style, so maybe i can embrace this
