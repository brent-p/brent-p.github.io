I made a pact with myself that I would aim to write at least one blog post a month but first month in and I am already struggling! So I have decided to kick off blogging for the year with somthing easy, listing off my goals for 2014.

So starting off:

1) Write some words about some things on my website at least once a month maybe even 2 times if I am feeling adventurous, probably not 3 times because that would be just showing off.

2) Finish off phase 2 of Much.ly with Dave you can see our progress here on our trello board [here][trello].

3) Finish off multi platform rewrite of DiamondRun

4) Complete another year of my CS degree

5) Code as much as possible

6) Get in a whole bunch of bicycle cycling in.

Short and sweet post for today but hopefully it will get the blog ball rolling.
