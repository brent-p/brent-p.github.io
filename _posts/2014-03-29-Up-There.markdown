Recently I went away on holidays and to fill in some down time I downloaded a few games for my tablet. One of those games was Pixel Dungeon and I was really impressed with the satisfaction I got from playing a simple but deep game. After recently making Diamond Run the cogs started to turn in my head and the more I thought about the more I thought that I might be capable of creating something like Pixel Dungeon.

As soon as I got home I got straight to work on it, you can see my progress on [my devlog on Tigsource][tig] and [grab the current build here][upthere]. Initially I wanted to create a game along the same lines as Pixel Dungeon but now I am starting to drift away from that original idea. I love simplicity and things that stick to their core elements. So after playing games like Fez and Super Brothers Sword and Sworcery I want my game to try and follow the same principles.

One of the things I have been working on is modifying Up There to work with the [Pyxel Edit map editor:][pyx]

So please feel free to download the current build and create your own maps!!

Map Creation Instructions/Notes:

  - Currently only supports 32x32 pixel tile sizes
  - Currently only supports maps that are the same width and height and which are 64 tilesX64 tiles or smaller
  - Currently only supports 1 layer in Pyxel Edit so merge your layers when you are ready to export
  - Currently only tile with index 0 is a non colliding(floor) tile so all other tiles with index > 0 will be collideable 
  - Export tileset as tileset.png and place it in the tilemap folder
  - Export xml as tilemap.xml and place it in the tilemap folder
  - You will probably spawn in a bad positions so press "n" to toggle collision detection on/off 
  - Please note I have only tested it with the free version of Pyxel Edit.
  - Thats it! Let me know if you have any issues.


I will leave you with this frog thing:
