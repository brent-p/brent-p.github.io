<h3>IGDA Sydney Impressions:</h3>
Recently I managed to attend my first [Sydney IGDA meetup][igda_meetup] and I had a fantastic time, met alot of people and learnt alot.

I have wanted to go ever since I had found out about [IGDA Sydney][igda_twitter] but due to ill timed uni exams I so far had not been able to make it. After I saw a reminder pop up in my Twitter feed I managed to convince my friend the day before to come along for the 2 and a half hour drive to Sydney with me. 

Driving up I had no real idea of what the event would be like. Would it just be a couple of friends hanging out, or a more formal event with a schedule and speakers? Looking at the amount of people who had RSVPed to the [meetup page][igda_meetup] and guessing that most people wouldnt RSVP(like myself) I guessed there would be a fair amount of people turning up.

So far only close friends had played my game([you can download it here][build]) as its really just a prototype. I wasn't really expecting to demo my game but I thought I would bring my laptop and contoller along just in case but even then I didn't think anyone would play it.

Boy was I wrong! Despite my simple game I had a constant stream of people taking the time to introduce themselves and trying it out. By the time I got a chance to eat my dinner it had already gone cold! Everyone was super friendly and had lots of useful feedback to share that I'll be sure to implement when I get the chance. Watching people play something you have made no matter how simple is by far the best feeling and a massive motivator.

Overall it was a great experience that I would recommend to anyone who is working on a game to meet like minded people and get valuable feedback.

<h3>What I learnt:</h3>
Most of these things in hindsight seem obvious but because I really only decided to go the day before I was a bit unprepeared.

<ul>
	<li>
		Bring a Note pad! This is something really simple that I wish I had brought to write down observations, ideas, feedback and other people's contact details to catch up with later.		
	</li>
	<li>
		Watching other people play your game is a super eye opening experience and things you take for granted or don't see as a big deal can be a big thing to the player.
	</li>
	<li>
		I didn't make a build with demoing it in mind but for next time, having a simple button to reset the game for the next player would have saved me from fumbling about in the IDE while the player was waiting.
	</li>
	<li>
		I noticed one of the other games had a sign showing the controls so I hope to steal that idea for next time. So the player can just pick up and play.
	</li>
	<li>
		Having some simple business cards to hand out with name, email, twitter handle so that its easy to catch up with people after the event, I met so many people that struggled to remember peoples names so I'm guessing they have probably forgotten mine too.
	</li>

	<li>
		 I hadnt spent anytime on placeholder art but other people commented that they liked the simple style, so maybe I can embrace this.
	</li>
</ul>


<h3>Looking for a student artist!</h3>
This may be a bit unrealistic but I would love to submit something in the student IGF so if you are an artist and currently a student or know of some one who is, send me an email hello@brentparish.com and get in touch, I would love to chat.
