<div class="post">
<p>Recently I managed to attended my first Sydney IGDA meetup<p/></p>

<p>wanted to attend for a while, when I first founnd out about IGDA a meetup happend the day before, then I was unable to attend because I had a uni exam the next day. Managed to convince my friend the day before to drive to sydney with me from newcastle. </p>

<p>Decided the night before &gt; so had to quickly got a build together the night before.</p>

<p>Had kind of given up on the game as scope might be too big</p>

<p>Want to submit something in the student igf</p>

<p>Everyone was super friendly and willing to take the time to give me adivce and feed back</p>

<p>learnt lots of things
most are pretty obvious but didnt really think about as only decided to go the day before, plus I didnt really expect anyone to play my game
    - Need an easy reset button so easy to setup the game for the next player
    - Need to show/explain what the controls are
    - Need basic business cards with contact details
    - Notepad to write down observations,ideas,feedback and other peoples contact details
    - hadnt spent anytime on placeholder are but other people commented that they liked the simple style, so maybe i can embrace this</p>
