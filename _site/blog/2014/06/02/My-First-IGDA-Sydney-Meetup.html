<h3>IGDA Sydney Impressions:</h3>

<p>Recently I managed to attend my first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/igda-sydney/">Sydney IGDA meetup</a> and I had a fantastic time, met alot of people and learnt alot.</p>

<p>I have wanted to go ever since I had found out about <a href="https://twitter.com/IGDA_Sydney">IGDA sydney</a> but due to ill timed uni exams I so far had not been able to make it. After I saw a reminder pop up in my Twitter feed I managed to convince my friend the day before to come along for the 2 and half hour drive to sydney with me. </p>

<p>Driving up I had no real idea of what the event would be like, would it just be a couple of friends hanging out? or a more formal event with a schedule and speakers? Looking at the amount of people who had rsvped to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/igda-sydney/">meetup page</a> and guessing that most people wouldnt rsvp(like myself) I guessed their would be a fair amount people turning up.</p>

<p>So far only close friends had played my game(<a href="/projects/2014/05/31/Up-There.html">you can download it here</a>) as its really just a prototype. I wasn&#39;t really expecting to demo my game but I thought I would bring my laptop and contoller along just in case but even then I didn&#39;t think anyone would play it.</p>

<p>Boy was I wrong! Despite my simple game I had a constant stream of people taking the time to introduce themselves and trying it out. By the time I got a chance to eat my dinner it had already gone cold. Everyone was super friendly and had lots of useful feedback to share that I&#39;ll be sure to implement when I get the chance. Watching people play something you have made no matter how simple is by far the best feeling and a massive motivator.</p>

<p>Overall it was a great experience that I would recommend to anyone who is working on a game to meet like minded people and get valuable feedback. The atmosphere was relaxed and while I dont really know if everyone was with the meet up I&#39;m guessing about 50-60 people turned up on the night.</p>

<h3>What I learnt:</h3>

<p>Most of these things that in hindsight seem obvious but because I really only decided to go the day before I was a bit unprepeared.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Bring a Note pad! This is something really simple that I wish I had brought to write down observations, ideas, feedback and other peoples contact details to catch up with later.       
    </li>
    <li>
        Watching other people play your game is a super eye opening experince and things you take for granted or don't see as a big deal can be a big thing to the player.
    </li>
    <li>
        I didn't make a build with demoing it in mind but for next time, having a simple button to reset the game for next player would of saved me from fumbling about in the IDE while the player is waiting.
    </li>
    <li>
        I noticed one of the other games had a sign showing the controls so I hope to steal that idea for next time. So the player can just pick up and play.
    </li>
    <li>
        Having some simple business cards to hand out with name, email, twitter handle so that its easy to catch up with people after the event, I met so many people that struggle to remember peoples names so I'm guessing they have probably forgot mine too.
    </li>

    <li>
         I hadnt spent anytime on placeholder art but other people commented that they liked the simple style, so maybe I can embrace this
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Looking for a student artist!</h3>

<p>This may be a bit unrealistic but I would love to submit something in the student IGF so if your an artist and currently a student or know of some one who is, send me an email hello@brentparish.com and get in touch I would love to chat. </p>
